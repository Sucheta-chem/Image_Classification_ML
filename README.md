# Image_Classification_ML
A dataset of ~ 25K images (each of size 150 x 150) with each image having a label from the following 6 categories: {'buildings': 0, 'forest': 1, 'glacier': 2, 'mountain': 3, 'sea' : 4, 'street': 5}, is subdivided into 3 subsets: TRAIN (folder: seg_train): ~14K, VALIDATION (folder: seg_test): 3K, PREDICTION (folder: seg_pred): 7K. We have tried to carry out the following tasks:
1. Firstly, we have employed a fully-connected feed-forward neural network with H hidden layers (each containing N neurons) to classify the dataset. We have used some fixed values of H and N. Say, H=2, N=100. We have furthur used the validation set to determine the number of epochs for early stopping. In the process we have implemented dropout and other regularization techniques and tried to have an estimate for the accuracy of the PREDICTION set.
2. In the second part we have used a Convolutional Neural Network to perform the same task as described in (1) above. We have designed a CNN of our choice, e.g., (CONV - ReLU) - MAXPOOL - (CONV - ReLU) - MAXPOOL - (FC - ReLU) - (FC - SOFTMAX). In the process we have implemented dropout and other regularization techniques and tried to have an estimate for the accuracy of the PREDICTION set, in a similar way as described in (1).
3. In this course we also presented the idea behind GloVe-Global vector for word representation. The presentation slides are based on a [paper](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1162/)
